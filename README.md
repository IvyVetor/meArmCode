The meArm is a "pocket sized robot arm" I purchased online at hackaday.com.

The physical part took about 3 days (including wiring it correctly onto the breadboard and arduino).
Arduino model: R3 Uno

Coding took about a week. It could still use some fine-tuning. I tried adding methods and loops but didn't work. I suspect I might need to add a library (or two?) to make the methods and loops work.
